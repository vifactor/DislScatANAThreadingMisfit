This is the program to calculate X-ray diffraction 
from an epitaxial sample containing threading and misfit dislocations
with the help of analytical correlation functions.

Three possible experimental geometries are implemented: skew (double- and triple crystal)
and coplanar geometry.

Each geometry setup requires its own way to calculate diffraction integral.
In particular advanced MC methods are used.
